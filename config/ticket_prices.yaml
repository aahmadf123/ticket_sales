# INFLATION AND PRICING POLICY
# =============================================================================
pricing_policy:
  # Annual inflation applied to all prices
  annual_inflation_rate: 0.03  # 3% per year

  # 5-year planning horizon
  planning_years: 5

  # Price increase formula:
  # Year N price = (Year N-1 price * 1.03) + model_predicted_increase
  # This means 3% is the baseline (just keeping up with inflation)
  # Any model-predicted increase is REAL growth above inflation

  # Maximum constraints
  max_annual_increase: 0.15  # 15% max to limit churn
  min_annual_increase: 0.00  # Can freeze prices if needed

# =============================================================================
# ELASTICITY TIERS
# =============================================================================
# Elasticity = how demand changes with price
# More negative = more price sensitive (careful with increases)
# Less negative = less price sensitive (can increase more)

elasticity_tiers:
  premium:
    # High-end seats: wealthy buyers, less price sensitive
    base_elasticity: -0.35
    range: [-0.5, -0.2]
    description: "Premium seating - very inelastic, can increase aggressively"
    optimal_annual_increase_range: [0.08, 0.12]  # 8-12% above inflation

  mid_tier:
    # Middle-range seats: mixed audience
    base_elasticity: -0.6
    range: [-0.8, -0.4]
    description: "Mid-tier seating - moderately inelastic"
    optimal_annual_increase_range: [0.05, 0.08]  # 5-8% above inflation

  standard:
    # Standard seats: general fans
    base_elasticity: -0.9
    range: [-1.1, -0.7]
    description: "Standard seating - near unit elastic"
    optimal_annual_increase_range: [0.03, 0.05]  # 3-5% above inflation

  budget:
    # Budget seats: price-sensitive buyers
    base_elasticity: -1.3
    range: [-1.6, -1.0]
